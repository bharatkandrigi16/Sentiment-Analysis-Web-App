Indeed, the movie often feels as if it starts after all the good stuff left off. A general low-energy quality keeps things from ever getting very tense or exciting, and the generic title - just what is a Trigger Point anyway? Is it something to do with a gun? This will probably make this movie fade away quietly and painlessly."
